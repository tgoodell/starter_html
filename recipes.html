            <h2>Pesto Pasta</h2>

            <p><b>Origin:</b> Italian</p>

            <p><b>Source:</b> <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/fresh_basil_pesto/">Simply Recipes</a></p>

            <p><b>Category:</b> Main Dish</p>

            <a src="images/recipes/pesto-pasta/pesto_pasta.jpg" alt="A bowl of Pesto Pasta with a garnish on top" />

            <p>Pesto pasta has always been a comfort dish for me; it’s quick, it’s easy, and great food for a dinner party or a comfy night in! It requires six main ingredients, plus additional spices as you see fit. If you’re not in the mood for pasta, you can always eat the pesto sauce on bread, crackers, or eggs! This recipe makes enough for around 4 people, so adjust accordingly. </p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups fresh basil leaves, packed (can add some spinach if you don't have enough basil leaves)</li>
                <li>3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan or Romano cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1/3 cup pine nuts (can sub with same amount of chopped walnuts)</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
                <li>8 oz of your choice of pasta (my preferred is penne, but any type will work)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat up water in a pot for the pasta and put in a teaspoon of salt. </li>
                <li>Pulse the basil and pine nuts in a food processor. Add a bit of olive oil as need be if the ingredients are too dry. </li>
                <li>Add the garlic and cheese to the food processor. </li>
                <li>Once water starts boiling in the pot, add pasta. Stir every couple of minutes. </li>
                <li>While the food processor is running, slowly pour in olive oil. </li>
                <li>Once pasta is al-dente, turn off the heat and drain the pasta water. Save some of it if you want your pesto to be slightly thinner. </li>
                <li>Add the pasta back into the pot, mix in the pesto, and voila! </li>
            </ol>

            <p>This meal is a cheap and easy alternative to the classic cheap college meal: ramen noodles. It cooks up in about 10 minutes, and offers a ton of flavor and a more filling alternative to the typical packaged food. There is also plenty of room for culinary freedom and expression by adding extra sauces or spices, and substituting the pork for something like chicken for a healthier protein option.</p>
        
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup chili garlic sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 lb. ground pork</li>
                <li>2 3oz. packages ramen noodles (seasoning packets discarded)</li>
                <li>3 green onions, sliced</li>
                <li>1/4 cup unsalted peanuts, chopped</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the chili garlic sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the ground pork to a skillet and cook over medium heat until it is fully browned. Once browned, add the prepared dragon sauce and chopped peanuts. Allow the pork and peanuts to simmer in the sauce for another 5 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced by half.</li>
                <li>While the pork is browning, begin boiling water for your noodles. Once boiling, add your noodles and cook according to the package directions. Drain the noodles in a colander.</li>
                <li>Once the sauce has reduced and the noodles have drained, add the noodles to the skillet and toss until everything is combined and coated in sauce. Top with sliced green onions and serve!</li>
            </ol>
